/**
 * A sealed interface representing a travel recommendation.
 * 
 * <h2>Purpose in Architecture</h2>
 * <p>This interface forms the foundation of the type hierarchy for all recommendations
 * in the travel system. It defines the common contract that all recommendation types
 * must fulfill, while using the sealed modifier to strictly control which implementations
 * are permitted.</p>
 * 
 * <h2>OCP Java 21 Feature: Sealed Types</h2>
 * <p>Sealed types (introduced in Java 17, refined in Java 21) allow precise control over
 * class hierarchies by explicitly specifying which classes can implement an interface or 
 * extend a class. This enables:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Closed polymorphism</strong>: The compiler knows all possible subtypes</li>
 *   <li><strong>Exhaustive pattern matching</strong>: Switch expressions can safely cover all cases</li>
 *   <li><strong>Better domain modeling</strong>: The class hierarchy accurately reflects the domain constraints</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>In this example, only four record types are permitted to implement this interface:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link FlightRecommendation}: For flight booking recommendations</li>
 *   <li>{@link HotelRecommendation}: For hotel stay recommendations</li>
 *   <li>{@link ActivityRecommendation}: For activity and excursion recommendations</li>
 *   <li>{@link PackageRecommendation}: For bundled travel packages combining the above</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h2>Usage with Pattern Matching</h2>
 * <p>The sealed nature of this interface enables exhaustive pattern matching in switch expressions:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * String describe(Recommendation rec) {
 *     return switch(rec) {
 *         case FlightRecommendation flight -> "Flight to " + flight.arrivalAirport();
 *         case HotelRecommendation hotel -> hotel.starRating() + "-star hotel";
 *         case ActivityRecommendation activity -> "Activity: " + activity.activityName();
 *         case PackageRecommendation pkg -> "Package with " + pkg.activities().size() + " activities";
 *         // No default needed - compiler knows these are all possibilities
 *     };
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <h2>OCP Java 21 Exam Note</h2>
 * <p>For the OCP exam, understand that:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>All permitted subclasses must be in the same module as the sealed type</li>
 *   <li>All permitted subclasses must extend/implement the sealed type</li>
 *   <li>All permitted subclasses must use a modifier: {@code final}, {@code sealed}, or {@code non-sealed}</li>
 * </ul>
